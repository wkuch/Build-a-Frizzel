This project was a gift for my girlfriend. 

It was built with [react](https://reactjs.org) ([Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) and [evergreenUI](https://evergreen.segment.com/). 

To test it run 
`yarn` to install dependencies and
`yarn start` to run locally

Then you can customize this Frizzel monster:
